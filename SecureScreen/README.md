SecureScreen
============

My workstation setup includes having the screenSaver come up after 1 minute and lock the screen (in case I wander off and forget).
Sometimes, what I'm working on involves stopping to read for longer than that.  Hence, this util.

This util for Windows runs a tiny transparent window (defaulting to the top-left corner of the default monitor)
 that will suppress the screenSaver when the mouse hovers over it.
Additionally, you can drag it around with the left mouse button, and a right-click (when it has focus) locks the screen now.
You can close it with the middle mouse button.

The window is always transparent, but turns magenta when blocking the screenSaver, and yellow if it had issues interacting with the screenSaver.
