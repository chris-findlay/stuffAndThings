# BlockTimer Sizing Config #
############################

# Comments start with a '#' and are ignored.  Tabs in this file are expected to be 4-spaces wide.

# Entries are in order from shortest time to longest,
#  and are made up of:
# Time, LeftEdge, TopEdge, FractionOfScreenWidth, FullHeight, Opacity
#  where they are:
# Time:
#	seconds left - the time at which this line will be in full effect.
# LeftEdge:
#	'-':		no change;
#	any number:	the timer will be at the left edge of the screen.
# TopEdge:
#	'-':		no change;
#	any number:	the timer will be at the top edge of the screen.
# FractionOfScreenWidth:
#	how wide to make the window, as a fraction of the screen size (subject to a minimum window size, configured below).
# FullHeight:
#	'-':		no change;
#	any number:	the timer will be the full height of the screen.
# Opacity:
#	0.0 .. 1.0; the opacity of the timer window, when not being pointed at by the mouse.

# The actual time remaining will select 2 lines, and the resulting values used will be
#  the linear interpolation between the row just below and the time remaining next row.

# Read bottom-up to follow the changes as time runs out:

0		0, 0	1, 1		1.0		# FullScreen at 0s left.
5		0, -	1, -		1.0		# Full width at 5s left.
10		-, -	0.5, -		1.0		# Still half width at 10s left; fully opaque.
15		-, -	0.5, -		0.8		# Half the screen width at 15s left; slightly transparent.
20		-, -	0.25, -		0.7		# Double again by 20s remaining; slightly more opaque.
30		-, -	0.125, -	0.6		# Double in width from 35s to 30s remaining; slightly more opaque.
35		-, -	0.0625, -	0.5		# Stay that size till 35s.
60		-, -	0.0625, -	0.5		# Double in width from 65s to 60s remaining; slightly more opaque.
65		-, -	0.03125, -	0.4		# 1/32 screen width at 65s or more remaining; very transparent.
120		-, -	0.03125, -	0.4		#

# The following sets the smallest width the timer window can be:
Min-Width = 75
